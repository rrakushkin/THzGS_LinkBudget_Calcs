Ground System aims to optimize for the best trade off between antenna gain and pointing stringency. Therefore, the geff_gsAnt variable may change (various values are included in this link budget). Additionally, gs_ptg_error_loss reflects the loss due to +/- 0.05 deg pointing of gs antenna when the antenna has effective gain of 58.9 dBi roughly. The pointing  error loss drastically increases for larger gain antennas when holding pointing error constant. 

There are other variables who's values are not 100% certain and accurate, rough estimates are included for these values. These are the GS_feed_network_loss and GS_radome
